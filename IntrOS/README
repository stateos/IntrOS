IntrOS
---------
Free, simple and tiny cooperative operating system (OS) designed for deeply embedded applications.
Target: ARM Cortex-M family.
It was inspired by the concept of a state machine.
Procedure executed by the task (task state) doesn't have to be noreturn-type.
It will be executed into an infinite loop.
There's a dedicated function for immediate change the task state.
